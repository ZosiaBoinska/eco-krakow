## Page related to the zero-waste ideology. 

Website covers some important aspects of zero-waste ideology, which is becoming more popular all over the world. 
It gives some useful tips on how to start implementing more environment-friendly approach in everyday activities. It also has some Krakow-related adresses to help with shopping.

## How was it done.

I've created this website based on my self-taught knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This was my first website, so I used it to practice my skills and learn something new. 
The most interesting part for me was creating the quiz about garbage segregation and providing information about some adresses in Krak√≥w. 
Additionally, the part which also gave me satisfaction was to work on the website's responsivness.
